# python-string-assignment
A program that allows the users to choose between choice on what to do with their words or sentences.

# My learning experience 
When I started coding this program, I thought error handling and looping would be easy. Then I found out Python has no "do while" loop. I tried several times to think of an alternative until it worked.

Next, I learned indentation is very critical in Python unlike Java which allows you to put indentation everywhere. Python does not. One wrong space and the code fails.

I reached a point where I was sure my code was correct. It still failed. The issue was wrong indentation.

I also learned about f strings. They make string formatting easy and simple.
